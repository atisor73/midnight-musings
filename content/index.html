    So I realized I'm an idiot. I think I just forgot that after December 2020 comes January 2021 and did not check ANY expiration dates at the store. Like if I saw 2021, I just threw it in the basket. I guess I just have to eat eveything real fast.<br>
    Re-downloaded all my steam games. 1TB makes me feel like a fucking titan. I don't know how I'll get any work done this term. `baba is you` has been fun. I think strategy games are so low-committment in terms of remembering characters, names, journeys, etc. so they've stuck with me the longest. Also starting Untitled Goose Game tonight...

    Watched some surgeries today. The <em>only</em> kind of surgery I can't stand to watch is when they start cutting into eyes. 
    $$ x^2 < y $$    
    Also got latex working! MathJax is great.

    Scrolled through some of Amy Goodchild's work and code. Feeling inspired :-) Buuut I'm still here watching cooking shows. I need to go get myself one of those really long lighters to flambé. Thought about the word pancake a lot today. Are normal cakes ovencakes? Are waffles just toastercakes? The etymology of food words is too random for my liking. I think it's bc there have been times this year where I've made something, and I've made so many mistakes / substitutions that I'm not even really sure what to call it. I realize the more I cook, the more critical I am of restaurant food. I like fast food bc they're not pretending to be anything else or anything more, and it's just good and honest humble food. With some restaurant food I can just taste the laziness, and can now differentiate btw what's really been thoughtfully cooked and what was just added as an afterthought. The concept of plating feels disingenuous... I've much rather be on the other end I guess, the plater herself! <br><br>
    I'm thinking of some more adventurous recipes, gonna stuff some poblano peppers soon. Also pork belly and cauliflower purée sounds super doable, and brings back nice birthday memories. I'm so obsessed with buying different cheeses I can't really afford. Not just money-wise, but there's simply <em>no way</em> I can finish all that cheesse by myself before it goes bad. The two things I've mastered are spaghetti and chicken kiev. C H I C K E N  K I E V. Growing up on fast-food, Fried-Chicken-Friday, Taco-Bell-Tuesday, CHICKEN KIEV is like the adult version of my beloved chicken nuggets.

    MY TEXTBOOKS ARRIVED. So very excited. I think opening fresh textbooks is the best part of term. (there's still hope). There's a physical interpretation regarding antimatter where the little guys can be thought of as matter traveling backwards in time. I realize people don't <em>actually </em> think this, but it raises a very good question of what mathematical equivalence really means. If <em>all</em> the models we were able to come up with treated some phenomena as the same, how do we know they're really fundamentally different things happening? Is it just common sense? It's still neat that such a wicked interpretation can come from drawing a diagram and interpreting the arrow-switch the same way. <br>
    Here's my drawing for "The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect." I haven't had time to animate the thing, but if you repeatedly click on the picture and bend your screen repeatedly, you can pretend it's flying. <br>

    <center><div class="container-fluid"><div class="row">
    <input type="checkbox" id="insectoid"><label for="insectoid">  
        <img src="metamorphosis.PNG" width=300px>
    </label> 
    </div></div></center>

    For some reason the word petrichor makes me sad. It just <em>looks</em> sad. Also reminds me of isochores. Thermo has plagued my mind. <br>
    When I was little I thought deserts were boring, but now that I think about it, some of my favorite memmories have happened lying in cold sand staring at clear skies, where stars are their brightest.

    For all of you plant-lovers out there, go check out tree crowning and edelweiss flowers. The petal lengths look purposefully uneven. For some reason I've always loved daisies. They're not the most interesting, but I find the shape of the petals very inviting. I hate when people gift flowers. I always feel guilty for killing them. <br>
    I'm starting "Godel, Escher, and Bach." It's been a while since I've read non-female narratives. Found some lecturers worth watching by Cedric Villani. I was looking through my old journal the other day, and found lots of doodles of headless men. There's something so charming and figurative about the concept. Although, to be fair, at the time they were headless bc heads and faces are hard for me to draw. 
    
    I'm gonna go work on animating a drawing in "The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect". I should maybe finishing reading it too.

    Discovered Alfred workflows, but too lazy to start writing any. 
    Planning to look at cicada 3301 puzzles sometime. On day 11 of advent of code! Skipped day 7 part 2 bc I suck at recursion. I'm trying to learn a bit of assembly but it's so boring. The names of the commands look cool though, like some 25th century attempt at  abstract poetry. Maybe I just need to find a mini-project to motivate myself.
   Currently watching George Hotz program while I work. His keyboard is very soothing. I vibe with his brain, I think open sourcing his company is fucking genius. Avoids all the bullshit legal shit. Self driving cars are the most terrifying upcoming thing to a fellow skater/biker. Sometimes I rely on the driver <em>not</em>> to see me, or to like, behave slow and clumsly like a human. Ugh. Hopefully we'll survive it.

    The VSCode Red theme is surprisingly brilliant when working with HTML/CSS. All the tags sort of blend into the background so you can focus on the text and variables. I feel like I'm coding inside the guts of my enemies. <br>
    WPM is up to 130 on keybr! Although, this is without punctuation or capitalization and the words aren't even English. I can't tell if I'm actually improving or if it's bc of the new keyboard. I found my new favorite color the other day by complete accident. To make my blackened shrimp tacos, I peeled and de-veined the lil critters. Being full made me tired and lazy so I left the tails out for a day or two. Then BAM. I came back and they were this silvery shell-pink. An un-hexable moment.
