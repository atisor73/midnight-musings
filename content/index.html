I've been thinking a lot lately about what makes things special or unique or valued. Like, some creatures are cooler or worth preserving by their rarity or their looks or some combination thereof. 

have you ever loved a passage so much you like TYPED it out
like i have typed out entire stories
bc i just want my fingers
to have experienced them
as well
my thoughts on erasures: I want to remember ___ as the person who could think deeply and creatively, but can also be dark and ignorant all at once. To deny an ownership of an idea, a good idea from a very flawed person, is made under the assumption that smart people and smart ideas could not possibly be in the wrong when it comes to social and moral issues. Intellect and morality are spheres

    I had a dream recently about jolly ranchers, not the candy, but like, happy farmers, that called themselves The Jolly Ranchers. Speaking of, for all you farmers out there, there's a dating app called Farmers.only. I think my Jolly Ranchers joke would fly well there.
    I wonder what pescetarianism has done to the world, like if all the fish populations are suddenly experiencing more panic than usual. The concept is laughable and admirable all at once. Life just gets more exciting underwater. It makes sense, since the chemistry is cooler down there, and solutions and buffers and flows and things that calcify, re-dissolve, disintegrate, etc., etc. I wonder if things stuck on the ocean floor think of fish the way we think of birds. Like instead of "I wish I could fly", for them, it's "I wish I could swim." <br>
    Started a poem today... 
    <blockquote>
    <em>Sun lights her hair in a blue room<br>
    ribboned collarbones, plaited knees<br>
    twisted locks and gentle knocks</em><br>
    She turns—-
    </blockquote>
    FUCK poetry is impossible. Poetry is a lot easier with a tiny bit of wine.

    "Happy as a clam." How do we know clams aren't the most downright tortured creatures out there? So I just googled it and apparently during high tide the clams are safe from being plucked and eaten by us humans, and thus are at their "happiest." I love how we define happiness of an organism as the moment it's escaped our domination, ridden of our presence. See, "clammy hands" makes sense since your hands feel like clams. I'm trying to explain this to the man living on 5th street but he keeps screaming god words at me. <br><br>

    Reading Slouching Towards Bethlehem is such a disarming experience. I plan on one day typing out the entire book, I feel like some passages just need to flow out of my fingers. I thought a lot about last meals today. There's this article with pictures of all the selected meals throughout history, and the very first one was a single olive. An OLIVE. What a stylish way to go. <br><br>

    Losing friends are hard. Goodnight.

    Played Hollow Knight for a couple hours—the graphics are awesome, but corpse runs really make my blood boil. But after a while my fingers got better at killing things so really just some patience in the beginning. The map is huge! I'm floored that it only took 3 people to make this. Soundtrack is hypnotic. I recognize some themes from my orchestral days, but I think that the composition is sooo fitting. <br>
    Figured out how to stream and record on OBS today, I LOVE IT. I used to render using Blendr which took a lifetime, for some reason the app would stretch your audio, and you'd have to drag and drop and squeeze the audio bar to sync with the visuals, and after some masochistic efforts, it would toastercakes? an hour to render a 10 minute video in HD, and then you're left with rumbling fans writing pixel by pixel into each frame (how Blendr typically renders animations). Anyways. Thank the software gods for OBS. <br><br>
    I met someone who's been micro-dosing. Kinda cuious but also would be tempted to just take the full dose. So maybe this will have to wait for next break! Away from all the hype, I genuinely think regardless of the consequences, the idea itself is incredibly... creative. But also neurologically, I'm not sure how much of it is placebo, and how equilibria would readjust to the persistent presence of a foreign substance, and how it would learn to integrate (or disintegrate?) over prolonged periods of time. A wicked line from this special friend: "I guess I got tired of getting blind drunk and peeling myself off pavements." Being a visual learner and thinker means I can never look at a pavement again without seeing said friend being peeled off of it. <br><br>
    I've been getting some anonymous DM's on Instagram and they're super motivating. I pulled out a couple of old sketchbooks for the first time in a reeeaaal long time. It's so weird that when you're at school, the culture is very academia-oriented, but it's almost stigmatized in the art community, like you've sold your soul. Is academia just an artist selling out? Dark thoughts. <br>

    So I realized I'm an idiot. I think I just forgot that after December 2020 comes January 2021 and did not check ANY expiration dates at the store. Like if I saw 2021, I just threw it in the basket. I guess I just have to eat eveything real fast.<br>
    Re-downloaded all my steam shit. 1TB makes me feel like a fucking titan. I don't know how I'll get any work done this term. `baba is you` has been fun. I think strategy games are so low-committment in terms of remembering characters, names, journeys, etc. so they've stuck with me the longest. <br>
    Watched some surgeries today. The <em>only</em> kind of surgery I can't stand to watch is when they start cutting into eyes. 
    $$ x^2 < y $$    
    Also got latex working! MathJax is great. Just a one-liner. Hopefully some more exciting math coming soon.

    Scrolled through some of Amy Goodchild's work and code. Feeling inspired :-) Buuut I'm still here watching cooking shows. I need to go get myself one of those really long lighters to flambé. Thought about the word pancake a lot today. Are normal cakes ovencakes? Are waffles just toastercakes? The etymology of food words is too random for my liking. I think it's bc there have been times this year where I've made something, and I've made so many mistakes / substitutions that I'm not even really sure what to call it. I realize the more I cook, the more critical I am of restaurant food. I like fast food bc they're not pretending to be anything else or anything more, and it's just good and honest humble food. With some restaurant food I can just taste the laziness, and can now differentiate btw what's really been thoughtfully cooked and what was just added as an afterthought. The concept of plating feels disingenuous... I've much rather be on the other end I guess, the plater herself! <br><br>
    I'm thinking of some more adventurous recipes, gonna stuff some poblano peppers soon. Also pork belly and cauliflower purée sounds super doable, and brings back nice birthday memories. I'm so obsessed with buying different cheeses I can't really afford. Not just money-wise, but there's simply <em>no way</em> I can finish all that cheesse by myself before it goes bad. The two things I've mastered are spaghetti and chicken kiev. C H I C K E N  K I E V. Growing up on fast-food, Fried-Chicken-Friday, Taco-Bell-Tuesday, CHICKEN KIEV is like the adult version of my beloved chicken nuggets.

    MY TEXTBOOKS ARRIVED. So very excited. I think opening fresh textbooks is the best part of term. (there's still hope). There's a physical interpretation regarding antimatter where the little guys can be thought of as matter traveling backwards in time. I realize people don't <em>actually </em> think this, but it raises a very good question of what mathematical equivalence really means. If <em>all</em> the models we were able to come up with treated some phenomena as the same, how do we know they're really fundamentally different things happening? Is it just common sense? It's still neat that such a wicked interpretation can come from drawing a diagram and interpreting the arrow-switch the same way. <br>
    Here's my drawing for "The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect." I haven't had time to animate the thing, but if you repeatedly click on the picture and bend your screen repeatedly, you can pretend it's flying. <br>

    <center><div class="container-fluid"><div class="row">
    <input type="checkbox" id="insectoid"><label for="insectoid">  
        <img src="metamorphosis.PNG" width=300px>
    </label> 
    </div></div></center>

    For some reason the word petrichor makes me sad. It just <em>looks</em> sad. Also reminds me of isochores. Thermo has plagued my mind. <br>
    When I was little I thought deserts were boring, but now that I think about it, some of my favorite memmories have happened lying in cold sand staring at clear skies, where stars are their brightest.

    For all of you plant-lovers out there, go check out tree crowning and edelweiss flowers. The petal lengths look purposefully uneven. For some reason I've always loved daisies. They're not the most interesting, but I find the shape of the petals very inviting. I hate when people gift flowers. I always feel guilty for killing them. <br>
    I'm starting "Godel, Escher, and Bach." It's been a while since I've read non-female narratives. Found some lecturers worth watching by Cedric Villani. I was looking through my old journal the other day, and found lots of doodles of headless men. There's something so charming and figurative about the concept. Although, to be fair, at the time they were headless bc heads and faces are hard for me to draw. 
    
    I'm gonna go work on animating a drawing in "The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect". I should maybe finishing reading it too.

    Discovered Alfred workflows, but too lazy to start writing any. 
    Planning to look at cicada 3301 puzzles sometime. On day 11 of advent of code! Skipped day 7 part 2 bc I suck at recursion. I'm trying to learn a bit of assembly but it's so boring. The names of the commands look cool though, like some 25th century attempt at  abstract poetry. Maybe I just need to find a mini-project to motivate myself.
   Currently watching George Hotz program while I work. His keyboard is very soothing. I vibe with his brain, I think open sourcing his company is fucking genius. Avoids all the bullshit legal shit. Self driving cars are the most terrifying upcoming thing to a fellow skater/biker. Sometimes I rely on the driver <em>not</em>> to see me, or to like, behave slow and clumsly like a human. Ugh. Hopefully we'll survive it. 
   <br><br>
    The VSCode Red theme is surprisingly brilliant when working with HTML/CSS. All the tags sort of blend into the background so you can focus on the text and variables. I feel like I'm coding inside the guts of my enemies. <br>
    WPM is up to 130 on keybr! Although, this is without punctuation or capitalization and the words aren't even English. I can't tell if I'm actually improving or if it's bc of the new keyboard. I found my new favorite color the other day by complete accident. To make my blackened shrimp tacos, I peeled and de-veined the lil critters. Being full made me tired and lazy so I left the tails out for a day or two. Then BAM. I came back and they were this silvery shell-pink. An un-hexable moment.
